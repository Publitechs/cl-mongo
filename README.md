# cl-mongo


## Intro

[mongo is a scalable, high-performance, open source, schema-free, document-oriented database.](http://www.mongodb.org). 


This is a common lisp interface that allows you to work with a mongo document database.
This is not a driver (yet) as specified in the mongo documents; There is still some 
functionality I need to implement.


Various features are missing such as serialization of binary data and code, authentication, 
gridfs among other things.

In its current state cl-mongo provides the ability to insert, update and delete documents.
It also supports indexing.

I developed this using sbcl. I didn't rely on any sbcl extenxions so I expect this to run under 
other lisps as well.

## Installation

Use asdf to install cl-mongo. 

## A sample session

`(use-package :cl-mongo)`


`(db.use "test")`

This connects to the test database on the local mongo server listening on its default port.

`(db.insert "foo" (kv "document" "one") )`

Insert a key-value pair as the first document into collection "foo".

    (pp (iter (db.find "foo" 'all)))`

     {
        "_id" -> objectid(4B5CF28970DFF196A75FE1F0)
        "document"  ->  one
     }

Pretty-print the documents returned by the find command. iter will ensure that the cursor is
fully iterated over.


`(defvar *DOC* (make-document))`

Create a document. A document is collection of key-value pairs and a unique identifier called "_id".

       (add-element "tag" "key" *DOC*)`


       {  DOCUMENT 

       {
       tag  -> key 
       }
       }


    (add-element "array" (list 1 2 3 "hello") *DOC*)

    {  DOCUMENT 

    {
    tag  -> key 
    	 1 
    	 2 
    	 3 
    	 hello 
  	 array  -> NIL 
	 }
     }


Add various elements to the document.

`(db.insert "foo" *DOC*)`

Insert document into the database.

       (pp (iter (db.find "foo" 'all)))

       {
       "_id" -> objectid(4B5CF28970DFF196A75FE1F0)
       "document"  ->  one
       }

       {
       "_id" -> objectid(8B508D5CBB5D451D961F046D)
       "array"  -> [ 1, 2, 3, hello,]
       "tag"  ->  key
       }

Print the current contents.

      (defvar *DOC* (cadr (docs (db.find "foo" 'all))))`
      (add-element "tags" (list 'good 'bad 'ugly) *DOC*)
      (db.save "foo" *DOC*)
      (pp (db.find "foo" 'all))

      {
	"_id" -> objectid(4B5CF28970DFF196A75FE1F0)
      	"document"  ->  one
      }

      {
        "_id" -> objectid(8B508D5CBB5D451D961F046D)
      	"tags"  -> [ GOOD, BAD, UGLY,]
     	"tag"  ->  key
     	"array"  -> [ 1, 2, 3, hello,]
      }

Bind variable `\*DOC\*` to the second document returned by the find command, add an other element 
and save back to the collection.
